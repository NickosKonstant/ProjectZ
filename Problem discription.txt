Given a two - dimensional matrix representing a maze with a single arbitrary
starting and ending point, as well as an arbitrary number of wall blocks, you
are required to produce an application that will output an actor’s route in the
form of two - dimensional points from start to finish. The actor cannot possess
any knowledge of the route beforehand; it is required to “discover” the route
progressively, being only able to inspect and move to any squares that are
North, South, East and West from its current position.
